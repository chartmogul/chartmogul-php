# Upgrading to chartmogul-php 2.0.0

The package upgrade brings breaking changes to the Metrics API. All other APIs remain unaffected. Please note the following changes:

* If you used the Metrics API to get a customer's activities or subscriptions, make the following changes in the namespace
  - `ChartMogul\Metrics\Activities::all(["customer_uuid" => $cus->uuid]);` should be replaced by `ChartMogul\Metrics\Customers\Activities::all(["customer_uuid" => $cus->uuid]);`
  `ChartMogul\Metrics\Subscriptions::all(["customer_uuid" => $cus->uuid]);` should be replaced by `ChartMogul\Metrics\Customers\Subscriptions::all(["customer_uuid" => $cus->uuid]);`
